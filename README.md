# 💼 DINESH S – Professional Resume

Welcome to my resume repository! This project contains my latest **backend developer resume** written entirely in **LaTeX**, and **automatically compiled using GitHub Actions** every time I update it.

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

I believe in writing clean code — even when it comes to my resume. Using LaTeX and CI/CD (GitHub Actions), I maintain a **version-controlled, auto-updated PDF** of my professional profile. Fast, clean, and always fresh.
